<h2><b><ins>Lotus Notes - Change Lotus Notes Password:</ins></b></h2>
<br/><br/>

It is advisable to have backup of the original ID file before changing the password.<br/><br/>
To change the password, do the following steps:<br/><br/>
1. Start Lotus Notes<br/><br/>
2. Click File from the menu bar at the top.<br/><br/>
3. Click Security.<br/><br/>
4. Click User Security.<br/><br/>
5. Notes will ask you for your password. Type in your current password and press Enter.<br/><br/>
6. Notes opens the User Security dialog box, navigate to Security Basics and click the Change Password button. (It is just below the heading Your Login and Password Settings, in the 2nd section of the box.)<br/><br/>
7. Notes will ask for the password again. Type in your current password and press ENTER.<br/><br/>
8. Notes will ask for a new password. (For password criteria, see the section at the bottom of the script.)<br/><br/>
REMEMBER: You and only you are the owner of your Lotus Notes ID password! Store this password in a safe place and do not forget it. Help Desk technicians and Lotus Notes Administrators cannot reset your password as it is set and managed on YOUR local ID file and PC workstation for optimal client security.
