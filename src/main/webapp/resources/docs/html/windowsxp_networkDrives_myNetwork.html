<h2><b><ins>Connect a drive from My Network Places</ins></b></h2>
<br/><br/>

1. Click Start, click My Network Places, click Entire Network, and then double-click
Microsoft Windows Network.<br/><br/>
2. Double-click the domain that you want to open, this will list the servers connected to a
domain.<br/><br/>
3. Double-click the computer that has the shared resource you want to map. All the shared
resources for that computer automatically appear in the window.<br/><br/>
4. Right-click the shared drive or folder that you want to map, and then click Map Network
Drive.<br/><br/>
5. Click the drive letter that you want to use, and then specify whether you want to
reconnect every time that you log on to your computer.<br/><br/>
Please note: Network drives are mapped by using letters starting from the letter Z. This
is the default drive letter for the first mapped drive you create. However, you can select
another letter if you want to use a letter other than Z. Using this method you would
need to know where to look, so it might be a little bit more time consuming.<br/><br/>
6. Click Finish.<br/><br/>
7. A window opens that displays the contents of the resource you mapped.<br/><br/>
