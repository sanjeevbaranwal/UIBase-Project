<h2><b><ins>Instructions on Reducing Mailbox Size to 4GB:</ins></b></h2>
<br/><br/>

To sort through Lotus Notes to identify your largest emails and calendar items:<br/><br/>
1. In Lotus Notes, select the All Documents folder.<br/><br/>
2. Click on the 'Size' column header to sort all mail and calendar items from largest to smallest.<br/><br/>
3. Scroll to the top to find the largest sized items.<br/><br/>
4. Delete any items with large attachments that are no longer needed.<br/><br/>
Note: Removing attachments or emails from your Archive will not help to decrease your mailbox size. Any files subject to Zurich’s Records Management Policy or a Legal Hold must be maintained in the proper manner.<br/><br/>
To delete an attachment without deleting the email:<br/><br/>
1. Double click on an email with an attachment to open the email.<br/><br/>
2. Double click in the body of the email to edit the email.<br/><br/>
3. Right click on the attachment and select Delete.<br/><br/>
4. Confirm you want to delete the attachment when a pop-up appears.<br/><br/>
5. Save your changes when a second pop-up appears.<br/><br/>
Once you have deleted or moved a number of large attachments, run the email “Compact” process by following these 
<a href="#" onclick="openDoc(this);" id="urlPDF" name="LotusNotesCompactinMailDatabase.pdf">steps</a>.
<br/><br/>

Note: The compacting process may take up to 20 minutes. You will not be able to access your Lotus Notes email or calendar while it is compacting, so please plan accordingly. Other programs on your computer will not be affected during compacting.<br/><br/>
