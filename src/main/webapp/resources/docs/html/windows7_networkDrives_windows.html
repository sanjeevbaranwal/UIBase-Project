<h2><b><ins>Map drive â€“ Using windows option:</ins></b></h2>
<br/><br/>
Note: Take the details of the PC drive details about network drive which you want to connect.<br/><br/>
1. Start Windows Explorer.<br/><br/>
2. Click on Tools > Map network Drive. You will then get a dialogue box up which requires some details.<br/><br/>
3. Select a drive letter from the list.<br/><br/>
4. Click in the next box down that says 'Path' or "Folder".<br/><br/>
The below drive example will need to be slightly translated, but this is quite simple.<br/>
E.g.: T: data on Life_ops_27bath03\ops_data01\data\shared\cslifeTranslates to:\\Life_ops_27bath03\ops_data01\data\shared\cslife\data<br/><br/>
5. Type in the drive path and make sure that the box 'Reconnect at next log on' has a tick in it.<br/><br/>
6. Click OK.<br/><br/>
7. If it asks for a user name and password (and is for a different server than that which the person normally uses) put in ID and password that you have been given by security.<br/><br/>
