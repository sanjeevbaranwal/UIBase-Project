<h2><b><ins>Lotus Notes - To configure Lotus Notes using Citrix:</ins></b></h2>
<br/><br/>
NOTE: Please ensure you have the latest edition of the ICA client installed on your computer. If you do not have, please ensure you remember to uninstall the old ICA client first before installing the updated version.<br/><br/>
The NOTES.INI file used by Lotus Notes in Citrix is located in the U: drive, under U:\Windows.<br/><br/>
The Data folder used by Lotus Notes in Citrix is located in the U: drive, under U:\Notes<br/><br/>
WARNING: You always have to use the NOTES folder to set-up Citrix Lotus Notes.<br/><br/>
By default, when you first launches Lotus Notes from within Citrix, it should simply be asked to locate the ID file on the computer (if the ID file is not already located in the U:\Notes\Data folder), so that it can be copied by Notes into the U:\Notes\Data folder. Then, Notes finishes the configuration by itself.
However, if for some reason, you gets a Lotus Notes configuration window, simply follow these instructions:<br/><br/>
1. At the Choose Location window, highlight Office (Network), then click OK<br/><br/>
2. At the Welcome screen, click on Next.<br/><br/>
3. At the User Information screen, simply enter the user name (either the Notes User Name or the Notes Short ID). Then, enter the name of the Domino server (ex: USZNM106/ZI/USA/ZURICH), then click on Next.<br/><br/>
4. At the Notes ID File screen, click on the Browse button, then locate the ID file; this ID file should be located, by default, under U:\Notes\Data but can also be located somewhere else on the computer (ex: Desktop, network drive, etc.). Once the ID file is located, simply double-click on the ID file or use the Open button. If prompted to copy the ID file into the Data directory, say Yes.<br/><br/>
5. Then type your Notes password, then click on OK.<br/><br/>
6. When the Notes setup is complete, click on OK.<br/><br/>
